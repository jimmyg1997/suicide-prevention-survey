## Summary:
Apple presents a coding interview problem about Gray code, a binary code with consecutive values differing in only one bit and wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware to prevent temporary spurious values during transitions. Given a number of bits, generate a possible Gray code for it.

## Key Points:
- Gray code is a binary code with consecutive values differing in only one bit and wrapping around to avoid temporary spurious values during transitions.
- Apple posed a coding interview problem regarding generating a Gray code for a given number of bits.
- For example, for n=2, a possible Gray code would be [00, 01, 11, 10].
- Consider upgrading to premium for detailed solutions to coding problems.
- Practice mock interviews with FAANG-level interviewers to prepare for system design interviews, which are becoming more popular in software engineering interviews.
