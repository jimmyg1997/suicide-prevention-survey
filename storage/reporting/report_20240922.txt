In a first for South LA, a mixed-use development with an apartment complex atop a Costco is being built, taking advantage of a recent California law to expand housing supply. The project will have 800 units, 23% designated for low-income households, and is expected to create 400 jobs in the neighborhood, addressing the area's housing shortage and high home prices. The innovative partnership could set a new model for urban housing development. #Costco #HousingCrisis #CaliforniaLaw #MixedUseDevelopment 🏠🏙️

This problem, asked by Goldman Sachs, involves finding the lowest floor from which an egg breaks, using N identical eggs and a building with k floors. An algorithm is needed to determine the minimum number of trial drops required in the worst case scenario to identify this floor, illustrated with an example where N = 1 and k = 5. For more in-depth solutions, consider upgrading to premium or booking a mock interview with a FAANG-level interviewer from Exponent for system design interviews. #GoldmanSachs #Algorithm #InterviewPreparation #SystemDesign 🥚
