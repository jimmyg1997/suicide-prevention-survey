• MetaMask and Mastercard have collaborated on MetaMask Card, a debit card linked to MetaMask wallets with 30 million monthly active users. The card enables spending digital assets anywhere Mastercard is accepted, bridging crypto and real-world payments, initially launching in a limited pilot in the UK and EU. Baanx issues the card, Mastercard provides payment network, and Linea powers transactions. Users delegate eligible tokens to their MetaMask Card for self-custody until needed, converting crypto to fiat through Baanx for purchases, aiming to blend traditional finance with DeFi. This innovation challenges Apple's dominance with in-app contactless transactions, potentially reshaping payment processing. The broader trend towards real-world payments connected to digital assets is evolving, setting the stage for new fintech-DeFi integrations and competition in the crypto wallet space.

• The text highlights in-depth write-ups on top fintech and DeFi companies, inviting readers to join a premium community for Fintech and Web3 intelligence to advance careers. A disclaimer clarifies the newsletter does not offer investment advice. Contributors include Lex, Laurence, Matt, Farhad, Danny, Michiel, and Michael. An option to unsubscribe is provided. 📈🔍📰
