Hello! This week, we explore the myths of momentum investing and share an up-to-date backtest strategy by referencing Clifford Asness' paper on "Fact, Fiction, and Momentum Investing." Asness, a prominent figure in finance known for his contributions to algorithmic trading, co-founded AQR Capital Management in 1998, where he developed advanced models for trading decisions using statistical techniques and machine learning. Momentum investing, the strategy of buying well-performing securities and selling underperforming ones, has a rich history with empirical support and has been effective in global markets for over 212 years. Despite common myths, momentum returns are robust, not limited to small-cap stocks, and survive trading costs, making it a valuable strategy for both academic and practical investment contexts. #MomentumInvesting #CliffordAsness #EmpiricalResearch #InvestmentStrategies 👋
The persistence of momentum returns dispels the myth that they will disappear over time, supported by extensive historical data. Momentum strategies have a robust history and perform well across various geographies and asset classes, proving their viability. Critiques on momentum's volatility fail to recognize its superior risk-adjusted returns, making it a compelling investment strategy. Overall, the myths surrounding momentum investing lack merit, with empirical evidence highlighting its efficacy and stability as an investment strategy. #MomentumInvesting #Performance #Volatility #TheoreticalFoundation 📈
