Spotify's success after tough layoffs is evident with stock gains and improved margins, though user growth challenges remain in mature markets. Paid subscriptions drive revenue, but ad-supported user growth is slowing, impacting monetization potential. Future developments include new subscription plans, enhanced discovery features, and a focus on podcasting growth. #Spotify #UserGrowth #Monetization #Podcasting

Future growth hinges on strategic marketing, free products, and partnerships in developing markets. TikTok Music poses a significant threat to Spotify's dominance due to its aggressive user funneling and partnerships with major record labels. #Spotify #TikTok #music #monetization
