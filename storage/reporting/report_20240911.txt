- Create a map implementation with set and get functions.
- The set function sets a key to a value at a specific time.
- The get function retrieves the key at a given time.
- The map should maintain the value until it gets updated at a later time.
- Examples are provided to demonstrate the functionality.
- Practice with mock interviews to prepare for system design interviews.
